    ABSTRACT="Inserted in intelligent assistants context and part of the Advanced Distributed Assistant (ADA) project, this work proposes the adaptation of a speech recognition system that allows user interaction through voice commands, transcribing their commands, given in Portuguese, to text format, based on open-source software and available systems. A HMM-based system architecture is adopted. The preliminary system registered a 44.3% word error rate. Posteriorly, the system's acoustic model development will include a hyperparameter optimization stage and experiments with more complex approaches, an assistant specific language model will be introduced.",
